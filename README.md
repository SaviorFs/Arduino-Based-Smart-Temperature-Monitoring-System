# Arduino-Based Smart Temperature Monitoring System

This project is a full-stack IoT application designed to monitor ambient temperature using an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi and a DHT11 temperature sensor. It operates in a local development environment and uses a Node.js-based WebSocket server to relay data in real time between the Arduino and a browser-based dashboard. Users can observe temperature readings, configure custom thresholds, and receive immediate visual feedback through onboard LEDs.

## Features

- Real-time temperature updates displayed on a web dashboard
- Adjustable cold and hot thresholds configurable per user
- Visual LED indicators on the Arduino: Red (hot), Green (normal), Blue (cold)
- Two-way WebSocket communication between the Arduino and browser
- Threshold logic processed onboard with instant LED response
- Optional daily average chart toggle for historical overview


## System Overview

1. The **Arduino Uno R4 WiFi** reads ambient temperature values from a connected DHT11 sensor at regular intervals.
2. These readings are transmitted over a local network using the WebSocket protocol to a locally hosted **Node.js WebSocket server**.
3. The server receives incoming temperature data and broadcasts it in real time to all connected web clients, including a browser-based dashboard.
4. The **frontend dashboard** displays live temperature readings and provides controls for users to update cold and hot threshold values.
5. When thresholds are updated, the values are sent back to the Arduino, which compares the current temperature to the new thresholds and activates the appropriate **LED indicator** (Red, Green, or Blue) based on the temperature range.

## CI/CD Pipeline Details

A GitHub Actions-based Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is configured to automatically verify server functionality and backend reliability on every push or pull request to the `main` branch.

The CI/CD pipeline performs the following stages:

- **Checkout and Setup**  
  Retrieves the latest repository code and sets up Node.js version 18 on an Ubuntu environment.

- **Dependency Installation**  
  Installs project dependencies inside the `WebSocketServer` directory using `npm install`.

- **Code Linting**  
  Executes ESLint against the Node.js WebSocket server codebase. Lint errors are logged for review but do not fail the build at this stage.

- **Server Startup**  
  Starts the Node.js WebSocket server (`server.js`) in the background to enable real connection testing.

- **WebSocket Client Test**  
  Executes a custom Node.js script (`tests/websocket-test.js`) that connects to the running WebSocket server, verifies connection success, and sends a test message.

- **Firebase Admin SDK Test**  
  Executes another Node.js script (`tests/firebase-test.js`) that initializes Firebase Admin SDK, performs a write to the Realtime Database (`/ci_test_node`), and then cleans up the test data.

- **Server Shutdown**  
  Terminates the background Node.js server process to prevent lingering jobs in the GitHub Actions runner.

The CI/CD workflow ensures that:
- The WebSocket server boots without errors.
- Real-time WebSocket client connections can be successfully established.
- Firebase database connections are active and capable of writing.
- Basic code quality is maintained via linting feedback.

## Testing Documentation

Each major folder contains a `tests/` subfolder with a `tests.txt` file documenting the manual and code-based tests performed. These tests cover:
- WiFi connectivity and reconnection logic
- WebSocket communication between the Arduino and browser
- Threshold logic and LED behavior verification
- Error handling for failed sensor readings
- Open port validation and secure connection testing

Tools used during testing include:
- WebSocketKing (https://websocketking.com) for live WebSocket message testing
- YouGetSignal (https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/) for external port checking

## Deployment

This system is currently deployed and tested in a local development environment.

- The WebSocket server runs locally on port `8081` and accepts `ws://` connections from both the browser dashboard and the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi.
- The frontend interface is accessed directly via `index.html` opened in a browser.
- No NGINX reverse proxy or SSL (WSS) is currently configured, as the application does not require public access or secure WebSocket connections in this setup.
- Firebase services are accessed remotely for authentication and real-time database operations.

This setup is suitable for development and testing on a single machine or local network.

## Project Documentation

The following formal documents are available in the repository for review:

- [Software Requirements Specification (SRS)](./Software_Requirements_Specification_Documentation.pdf)  
  Defines system scope, requirements, and external interfaces.
  
- [Software Design Document (SDD)](./Software_Design_Document.pdf)  
  Describes architecture, component design, data models, and system interactions.
  
- [Testing Documentation](./Testing_Documentation.pdf)  
  Details unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and validation procedures.

These documents collectively define the system requirements, design, and verification processes used to develop the Arduino-Based Smart Temperature Monitoring System.
